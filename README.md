# playbook

Play |	Description |	Results |	Best Practices
--- | --- | --- | ---
Microservice Architecture | Breaks a monolithic application into self-contained microservices |	Results in easier to develop and maintain applications, autonomous and cross-functional teams, flexibility in using technologies and scalability| Loose Coupling, Stateless Application, Containerization
Cloud-Native Services | Design architecture with Cloud-Native services in mind | Results in reduced operations Cost, Elasticity, Scalability and Fault-Tolerant Applications| Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), Immutable Infrastructure, Dev-Prod Parity
API-First Development | Treats APIs as first-class citizens when a product or service is designed and provides a contract |	Results in Parallel development teams, reusability of the developed services, good developer experience, and reduced risk of failure. |	OpenAPI Specification, Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS), API Contracts
Data-Driven Solutions | Design your solution to be optimal to the problems that the data will have at scale	| Results in optimized response time, scalability, maximum value from the data | Event Storming, Domain Driven Design (DDD), Decoupled Persistence, Intelligent Search
Shift-Left Security | Security should not be an afterthought and should be built into the development process. | Results in rapid ATO, easier to resolve security issues, and reduced risk of failures | Security Scans, Encryption In-Transition and At-Rest, Penetration Testing
Automation Everywhere | Build a development pipeline that provides automation for developers and allows for rapid development	| Results in fast delivery, reduced risk of failure, measurable progress, version control	| Automated CI/CD pipeline, Automated Testing, Automated Monitoring/Alerts, Autoscaling
Built-in Quality | Quality should be part of the process and not a separate activity |	Results in lower costs, fewer bugs, increasing returns, and stakeholders confidence	| Test Driven Development (TDD), Behavior Driven Development (BDD), Unit/Integration/End-to-End/Load, Quality Gates | Human-Centered Design	Provide an approach that makes for a better user experience, including making information accessible to all constituents | Results in customer-driven solutions, maximum accessibility, good user experience	| Best practices include 508 compliance, United States web design system, code scaffolding, complete documentation
